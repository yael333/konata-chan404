# Hi, I'm Yael~ 🌙

Welcome to my digital grimoire! I'm a young witch in training, a cybersec enthusiast, and an avid supporter of free software. I'm also a firm believer in the power of cats, music, and esotericism.

you'll find that most of my work is self-driven, with a focus on Linux, cybersecurity, computing and anything that interests me.

## Some of my current programming interests at the moment are:

&emsp;~ Binary exploitation (kernel level specifically)\
&emsp;~ Windows internals and malware (Ü< VX >Ü)\
&emsp;~ Personal Computing (uxn, Plan9Front, DuskOS...)\
&emsp;~ (Un-)typed lambda calculus and other minimal forms of computation
